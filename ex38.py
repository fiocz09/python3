"""
When to Use Lists
1. If you need to maintain order. Remember, this is listed order, not sorted order. Lists do not sort
for you.
2. If you need to access the contents randomly by a number. Remember, this is using cardinal
numbers starting at 0.
3. If you need to go through the contents linearly (first to last). Remember, thatâ€™s what for-loops
are for.
